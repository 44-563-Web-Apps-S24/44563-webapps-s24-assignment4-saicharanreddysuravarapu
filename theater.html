            KHIRIN: I ask you, what do you want?<br>
            MERCHUTKINA: Tell them, my dear, to give me 15 roubles, and a month later will do for the rest.<br>
            KHIRIN: But haven't you been told perfectly plainly that this is a bank!<br>
            MERCHUTKINA: Yes, yes.... And if you like I can show you the doctor's certificate.<br>
            KHIRIN: Have you got a head on your shoulders, or what?<br>
            MERCHUTKINA: My dear, I'm asking for what's mine by law. I don't want what isn't mine.<br>
            KHIRIN: I ask you, madam, have you got a head on your shoulders, or what? Well, devil take me, I haven't any time to talk to you! I'm busy.... [Points to the door] That way, please!<br>
            MERCHUTKINA: [Surprised] And where's the money?<br>
            KHIRIN: You haven't a head, but this [Taps the table and then points to his forehead.]<br>
            MERCHUTKINA: [Offended] What? Well, never mind, never mind.... You can do that to your own wife, but I'm the wife of a civil servant.... You can't do that to me!<br>
            KHIRIN: [Losing his temper] Get out of this!<br>
            MERCHUTKINA: No, no, no... none of that!<br>
            KHIRIN: If you don't get out this second, I'll call for the hall-porter! Get out! [Stamping.]<br>
            MERCHUTKINA: Never mind, never mind! I'm not afraid! I've seen the like of you before! Miser!
