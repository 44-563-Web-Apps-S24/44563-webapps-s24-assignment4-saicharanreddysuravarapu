        <h3><i>The Author</i> by Anton Chekhov</h3>

        
        <h4>KHIRIN:</h4>
        <p>I ask you, what do you want?</p>
        <h4>MERCHUTKINA:</h4>
        <p>Tell them, my dear, to give me 15 roubles, and a month later will do for the rest</p>
        <h4>KHIRIN: </h4>
        <p>But haven't you been told perfectly plainly that this is a bank!</p>
        <h4>MERCHUTKINA:</h4>
        <p>Yes, yes.... And if you like I can show you the doctor's certificate</p>
        <h4>KHIRIN:</h4>
        <p>Have you got a head on your shoulders, or what?</p>
        <h4>MERCHUTKINA:</h4>
        <p>My dear, I'm asking for what's mine by law. I don't want what isn't mine.</p>
        <h4>KHIRIN:</h4>
        <p>I ask you, madam, have you got a head on your shoulders, or what? Well, devil take me, I haven't any time to talk to you! I'm busy....</p>
        <p>[Points to the door]</p>
        <p>That way, please!</p>
        <h4>MERCHUTKINA:</h4>
        <p>[Surprised]</p>
        <p>And where's the money?</p>
        <h4>KHIRIN:</h4>
        <p>You haven't a head, but this</p>
        <p>[Taps the table and then points to his forehead.]</p>
        <h4>MERCHUTKINA:</h4>
        <p>[Offended]</p>
        <p>What? Well, never mind, never mind.... You can do that to your own wife, but I'm the wife of a civil servant.... You
        <p>can't do that to me!</p>
        <h4>KHIRIN:</h4>
        <p>[Losing his temper]</p>
        <p>Get out of this!</p>
        <h4>MERCHUTKINA:</h4>
        <p>No, no, no... none of that!</p>
        <h4>KHIRIN:</h4>
        <p>If you don't get out this second, I'll call for the hall-porter! Get out!</p>
        <p>[Stamping.]</p>
        <h4>MERCHUTKINA:</h4>
        <p>Never mind, never mind! I'm not afraid! I've seen the like of you before! Miser!</p>
        <h4>SHIPUCHIN:</h4>
        <p>[Excitedly]</p> 
        <p>But you will admit that it's untidy! You spoilthe _ensemble_!</p>
